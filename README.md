# Project Dog Breed Classifier Overview
In this project we will train a convolutional neural network (CNN) on different dog breed
images, and then on passing a picture of dog, it will be able to predict the class of breed.
And if human picture is given to our CNN model, it will identify it as human but also it
will try to match a similar dog breed that closely matches the picture provided.
The datasets of this project is provided by udacity
